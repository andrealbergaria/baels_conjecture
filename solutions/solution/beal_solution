						Answer to Beal's Conjecture


	
If A^x + B^y = C^z , where A, B, C, x, y and z are positive integers and x, y and z are all greater than 2, then A, B and C must have a common prime factor.

Since A^x will have the same primes factor as A, we only consider A

If A , B and C are equal its impossible, because A+B = C cant be equal to C

If there is a prime on the equation then
    
    a) PrimeA + NonPrimeB = C
    
    The only possible common prime factor in a) is PrimeA (since it only has one factor)
    So C doesnt have PrimeA as possible common prime factor
    
    b) PrimeA + PrimeB = C
    two different primes , C cant be equal to either PrimeA or PrimeB (since its a sum), and hence can't share a prime common factor 
    
    c) Prime A + NonPrimeB = PrimeC
        two different primes (because is PrimeA + something, so they are different)
     
    d) NonPrimeA + NonePrimeB = PrimeC
    PrimeC can't be decomposed in sum of two non primes
    
    So, A,B,C must be NonPrimes (to have a common prime factor)
    
    Hipothese
    
    NonPrime1 + NonPrime2  = NonPrime3
    
    
    1) If NonPrime1 e NonPrime2 have common prime factors then NonPrime3 also has common prime factors
    
    
 	If we did have a common factor, in this case 3, then that could be put in evidence as in:
		2*3 + 3*7 = 27
		3(2+7) = 27 
    	and its assured that 3 divides 27,so 3 is a prime common number
   
   2) If they don't have common prime factors, then they don't share a common prime

Therefore A^x + B^y  = C^z , doesnt hold, for example if A is prime.
